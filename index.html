  <p>Growing up, I would always hear nostalgia-driven statements about how games are getting worse as time goes on, 
    so I wanted to put that to the test. I obtained data on the steam releases through Kaggle. The data was a little 
    difficult to work with, the Date category was not work and excel would not format it correctly even with its tool built 
    for doing that, which mean I could not sort it by date. I analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel’s “Analyze Data”
    function. The results are shown below.</p>
  <p>Hypothesis: Despite many people claiming that older games were better, newer games score higher ratings than older games.</p>
  <p>Method: Took the average rating of sample of 100s of game release on the same day, but in different years.</p>

  <p>Older games, in fact, receive worse view than newer ones.</p>
