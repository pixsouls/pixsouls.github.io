  <p>Owen Pick's analysis of game reviews over time</p>
  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Growing up, I would always hear nostalgia-driven statements about how games are getting worse as time goes on, so I wanted to put that to the test. I obtained data on the steam releases through Kaggle. The data was a little difficult to work with because the date category was not a date datatype and excel would not format it correctly even with its tool built for doing that, which mean I could not easily sort it by date. I analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel’s “Analyze Data” function. The results are shown below.</p>
  <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
  <p>Despite many people claiming that older games were better, newer games score higher ratings than older games.</p>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <p>The average rating of sample of 100s of game release on the same day was taken, but in different years.</p>
  <h1>Results</h1>

  <p>Conclusion: older games, in fact, receive slightly worse reviews than newer ones.</p>
  <h1>Possible Confounding Variables</h1>
  <ul>
  <li>In order to be able to actually process this data in excel, it had do be limited to just April, so it is possible, though unlikely, that the other month may have different results.</li>
  <li>It is possible that even though the games were released earlier in time, they were getting reviews to this day, and people might not be as forgiving today as they were back in 2015.</li>
  <li>If the bullet point above is true, it is also possible that older games may not still run on modern hardware, and thus people will review it negatively. but the opposite argument can be made about newer games</li>
</ul>
