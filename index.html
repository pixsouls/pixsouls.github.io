  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Growing up, I would always hear nostalgia-driven statements about how games are getting worse as time goes on, so I wanted to put that to the test. I obtained data on the steam releases through Kaggle. The data was a little difficult to work with because the date category was not a date datatype and excel would not format it correctly even with its tool built for doing that, which mean I could not easily sort it by date. I analyzed the data using Microsoft Excel’s “Analyze Data” function. The results are shown below.</p>
  <h1>Hypothesis</h1>
  <p>Despite many people claiming that older games were better, newer games score higher ratings than older games.</p>
  <h1>Method</h1>
  <p>The average rating of sample of 100s of game release on the same day was taken, but in different years.</p>
  <h1>Picture of Results</h1>

  <p>Older games, in fact, receive worse view than newer ones.</p>
